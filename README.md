# OBJECTIVE
All of us very well know that the road traffic accidents have emerged as a major public health hazard with a number of RTA’s taking place every year and so it is our responsibility to derive a suitable relationship between the accidents and the external factors that cause them so we can reduce the number of RTA’s and loss of life in the long run. Few factors that cause RTAs include the road and climate conditions, over speeding, distracted driving and jumping the red signal. So, the main objective of this project is to analyse the various road traffic accidents that had taken place in the United Kingdom from the year 2005 to 2014 from the dataset. In this project we will deploy various data visualization techniques and methodologies to find the pattern and insights from the dataset used. Several modelling techniques are used for data analysis in doing so to find out how to drive safely. From this project we will also know the parameters that cause traffic accidents. We can also get a lot of driving suggestions as well and control them in the long run.

# PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
The designed proposed methodology is intended to be portable to any visualization challenge; it presents a sequence of important analytical and design tasks and decisions that need to be handled effectively. Visualizing data is a complex process that contains complex problems and efficient methods of interpretation with greater efficiency, effectiveness and elegance. Adopting this methodology is about recognizing the key stages, considerations, and tactics that will help you navigate smoothly through the visualization project
In data analysis the analysis is 100% rigid is a bold statement to make rather a linear process and indeed some of the stages may occasionally switch in sequence and require iteration. That is new factors and branches to data can emerge at any stage and may affect the visualization strategy and solutions to it. so, it is important to keep the visualization technique flexible at all levels.

In data visualization one can rarely, if ever, say that a problem can have a single answer or a single best possible answer. It is much more about heuristic methods to determine the most satisfactory solutions.
